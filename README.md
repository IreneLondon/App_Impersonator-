# App_Impersonator-
 The sole aim of this project was to write SQL queries and statements to mimic interactions on an app.
Think about a calculating salary app and how it functions without task deductions. This query is an app impersonator.
The sole aim is to write SQL queries and statements to mimic app interactions. 
These statements and queries include; 
Creating a table to store the data.
Inserting data rows in the multiple tables.
Using an Update to emulate what happens when you edit the data in the app.
Using a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

The database includes three tables namely task_deadline, workers, and quality_of_work.
The task_deadline table contains names of workers, names of tasks, and hours assigned.
Workers table also contained names, age, department, gender, and address of workers.
